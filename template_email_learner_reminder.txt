Greetings!
We are looking forward to seeing you [days and dates], for Software Carpentry @ KU. There are a few things you’ll need to do before [day name] morning.
 
If you haven’t already done so, please review the workshop details, requirements, and schedule at the workshop’s GitHub page:

If you are a visitor to KU, you may also want to review information on visitor parking: http://parking.ku.edu/visitor-parking
 
Then take the pre-workshop survey. This will take between 5 and 10 minutes.
